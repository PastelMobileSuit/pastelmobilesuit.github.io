                            <p><i>Dark Dungeon</i> is a 2D stealth puzzler made for a Game Design course at the
                                University of Portland along with Justice Nichols and <a
                                    href="http://www.haileekenney.com/">Hailee Kenney</a>. The game was written entirely
                                in C# using the XNA framework over the course of two weeks. I served as team lead and
                                head designer and did a large portion of the programming. I was responsible for
                                implementing movement and collision detection, enemy line-of-sight, and the darkness
                                mechanics. I also designed levels 1, 2, and 5.</p>

                                <a href="http://www.up.edu/dir/directory/showperson.aspx?id=001481663">Dr. Andrew

                                    Kenney</a>. The project involved
                                creating an agent that would use its episodic memory to successfully navigate a state
                                machine. We continued with the project after graduating, and eventually got the agent to
                                a point where it was successfully able to navigate any of the randomized state
                                machines we gave it. We continued on with the project after graduation. The project is
                                now maintained by students taking Dr. Nuxoll's CS 493 course.</p>

                            <p>From 2014 to 2016, I worked as a Software Engineer at Puppet in Portland, OR. While there
                                I
                                worked primarily in Clojure, and was involved in a number of open source projects.</p>
                            <p><a
                                    href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9">trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9</a>
                                is a webserver service written with the <a
                                    href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper">trapperkeeper</a> service
                                framework. I was a core developer and added several new features to this
                                service, as well as tests and documentation. I also helped handle code review and
                                releases, and have the highest number of commits against the repository.</p>

                            <p><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server">Puppet Server</a> is an
                                implementation of Puppet's Puppet Master in Clojure. Puppet Server is written in
                                Clojure using the trapperkeeper service framework, and utilizes the
                                trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9 service mentioned above.
                                It runs on the JVM, and has vastly improved performance over the original Ruby version
                                of
                                the Puppet Master. I was a core developer, and contributed features to both the open
                                source and enterprise versions of the product, in addition to writing tests and
                                performing
                                code reviews.</p>

                            <p><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-hocon">puppetlabs-hocon</a> is a Puppet
                                module to handle enforcing the configuration of HOCON configuration files, which,
                                beginning with Puppet Server, we had
                                standardized on for configuration for all future Puppet products. As part of
                                this, I was also involved with
                                <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/Ruby-hocon">Ruby-hocon</a>, a reimplementation of
                                <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config">Lightbend's HOCON library</a> in Ruby. I
                                was a
                                core developer on these two projects as well, contributing features and tests, handling
                                releases, and performing code reviews.
                                As part of the requirements for these projects, I also wrote a new parser for the
                                original Lightbend
                                HOCON library to preserve formatting and ordering, which I did as an open
                                source contributor. I worked closely with the library's maintainer to develop the design
                                of this new parser, and also worked with him to have all my code and tests reviewed to
                                ensure
                                they met high standards of code quality. I have the second-highest number of commits
                                against the repository.</p>

                            <p>At Puppet, I was also a core developer of <a
                                    href="https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2017.3/filesync_about.html">File
                                    Sync</a>. File Sync is an Enterprise feature for Puppet Server that automatically
                                syncs Puppet Code across multiple Puppet Masters by exercising
                                git. In addition to being a cool feature on its own, working on it gave me experience
                                working with some more obscure features and internals of git.</p>

                                The title was developed alongside Brian Cain, Joseph Ritch, and Cory Buckley. I was a

                            <p>From 2016 to 2018, I worked as a Game Mechanics Programmer at TT Games in the United
                                Kingdom.
                                At TT, I gained experience working with creative people from multiple disciplines
                                in a long-standing C++ codebase. While there, I wrote or contributed to several
                                important, high-visibility mechanics, including a selfie mode that was shown at E3 2017.
                                I got the opportunity to make design decisions about mechanics I worked on, and gained
                                experience in numerous systems like combat, networking, cameras, and physics.
                                I was credited on <a

                            <p>One of my first mechanics at TT was the Creation mechanic, a major mechanic built for
                                <i>Lego Dimensions</i>. This mechanic utilizes a physical toypad peripheral, and
                                requires a player to place
                                a toy on three colored spots on that peripheral in whatever order they choose. Depending
                                on the order, one of six creatures is automatically created and spawned from LEGO
                                Bricks, and interacts
                                with something in the environment to allow the player to progress. </p>

                            <br><img src="img/Screenshots/TT/Selfie.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br>
                            <p>I was also given the opportunity to craft a selfie mechanic for <i>Lego Marvel Super
                                    Heroes 2</i>. This mechanic allows the player to take out a cell phone and take a
                                live selfie in-game, which is
                                then saved in local storage. This photo can then be placed on billboards in the game
                                world. The selfie mode comes complete with snapchat-style filters, which I came up with
                                myself.</p>

                            <p>I currently work at GitHub, where I am a Software Engineer based remotely in Portland,
                                OR.
                                At GitHub, I have worked primarily in Go, with some light work in Ruby.</p>
                            <p>I currently work on the Data Infrastructure team, where I am contributing to the
                                development of
                                a company-wide solution to handle cloud object storage. I am also currently the lead
                                maintainer of Alambic, an internal Go service that handles uploads and downloads of
                                various
                                types of user content, including Avatars.
                            </p>
                            <p>Before my time on the Data Infrastructure team, I was on the Git Ecosystem team. While on
                                that team,
                                I was the tech lead on GitHub's internal server-side implementation of <a
                                    href="https://github.com/microsoft/vfsforgit">Microsoft's VFS for Git project</a>, a
                                tool to allow Git
                                to run efficiently when working with very large monorepos. In this role, I wrote code,
                                made architectural decisions, led meetings, planned work, and worked closely with both
                                the team manager and the product team to communicate progress to customers and internal
                                stakeholders. I also worked closely with the product team to develop onboarding and
                                testing plans
                                for customers who wanted to test VFS for Git in an alpha state. As VFS for Git is a
                                Microsoft project, I also
                                regularly met with their internal VFS for Git team to discuss progress and exchange
                                ideas, both
                                before and after Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub.
                            </p>
                            <p>During my time at GitHub, I have also been a contributor to the open-source <a
                                    href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs">Git LFS Project</a>, a tool that allows
                                Git
                                to work well with large files by storing them outside of a git repository. While this
                                project was never my primary focus at the company, I developed a few features for it and
                                was at one point the primary code reviewer for most of the PRs made by the project's
                                chief maintainer.</p>
